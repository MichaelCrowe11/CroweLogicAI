# Crowe Logic AI Development Roadmap

This roadmap summarizes near-term and future milestones for the Crowe Logic AI platform. It draws from the blueprint in the repository and focuses on progressive delivery of core modules and user value.

## Short-Term Goals (0–2 Months)

- **Repository & CI Setup**
  - Establish Next.js + Tailwind base app with automated linting and build in CI.
  - Scaffold the UI shell (sidebar, central chat area, logs panel) with dark mycelium-inspired theme.
- **Module Scaffolding**
  - Create starter packages for MycoIntel, LabFlow, and BizGenesis.
  - Add JSON schema templates for batch reports, strain catalog, and grow logs.
- **Basic Agent Memory**
  - Integrate Redis or Supabase to persist user sessions and memory threads.
- **Early Document Parsing**
  - Enable file uploads for PDF, JSON, or DOCX with simple parsing into chat context.

## Medium-Term Goals (2–6 Months)

- **Complete Core Modules**
  - Implement the main features of MycoIntel, LabFlow, EcoLogic, and BizGenesis.
  - Build a starter library of SOPs, species data, and business model prompts.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**
  - Integrate Whisper API for voice commands and incorporate image uploads for batch logs.
- **Agent Workflow Chains**
  - Introduce Codex prompt chains for scheduling, research, and advisory tasks.
- **Initial User Testing**
  - Launch a closed beta to gather feedback on usability and module functionality.

## Long-Term Goals (6+ Months)

- **Advanced Ecosystem Mapping**
  - Expand EcoLogic into a full regenerative planning tool with mapping overlays.
- **Plugin/Module Marketplace**
  - Offer a registry of add-on packages through GitHub releases.
- **Scalability & Integrations**
  - Migrate to robust cloud storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2) and refine auth with a provider like Auth0.
  - Provide API endpoints for external apps or partners.
- **Community & Open Source**
  - Foster contributions through documentation, issue templates, and community channels.

## Potential Obstacles and Mitigation

1. **Complexity of Multi-Module Architecture**
   - *Mitigation*: Start with clear boundaries between modules and shared utilities. Use monorepo tooling (pnpm workspaces) to manage dependencies.
2. **Resource Intensive AI Workloads**
   - *Mitigation*: Cache results where possible, adopt serverless functions for burst workloads, and monitor usage.
3. **User Adoption and Feedback Loops**
   - *Mitigation*: Deploy early to a small group of testers, iterate quickly, and maintain open communication channels.
4. **Security and Compliance**
   - *Mitigation*: Use established auth providers and follow best practices for data storage and encryption. Incorporate periodic security reviews.

## Generative Code Assistant Integration

Generative code assistants can accelerate module development and documentation. By connecting the Crowe Codex interface to tools like OpenAI's GPT models or local code LLMs, developers can generate boilerplate code, automate tests, and create sample schemas directly from the chat console. Integrating these assistants with the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) ensures code suggestions remain consistent and secure, while freeing the team to focus on higher-level design and experimentation.
